# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Weather App ☀️☔
This is a weather application built with Node.js and Vite. It allows you to easily check the current weather conditions and forecasts for your desired location.

Features:
Get real-time weather data for any city.
View current temperature, feels like, weather description, wind speed, and more.
See a multi-day forecast for planning your week.
Clean and user-friendly interface.
Setting Up the App:
Install Node.js and npm:

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can download them from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en

Clone the repository (if downloaded):

If you downloaded this project as a zip file, extract it to a desired location. If you cloned it from a Git repository, you can skip this step.

Install dependencies:

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

Bash
npm install
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will install all the necessary dependencies required by the app to function.

Update API Key:

This weather app utilizes an external weather API to retrieve data. To personalize your experience, you'll need to replace the placeholder API key with your own. Navigate to the src/config.js file and locate the following line:

JavaScript
const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
Use code with caution.
content_copy
Important: Replace YOUR_API_KEY with your actual API key obtained from a weather service provider like OpenWeatherMap (https://openweathermap.org/).

Start the development server:

Once you've updated the API key, run the following command in your terminal to start the development server:

Bash
npm run dev
Use code with caution.
content_copy
This will launch the app in your web browser, usually at http://localhost:5173/.
